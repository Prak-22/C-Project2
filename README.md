Multi-Level Parking Lot Interface

A multi-level car parking system is an incredibly good substitute for the car parking area. The population of 
the world was increased day by day and the town and cities increase or developed their public 
transport. Due to an increase in population car, bike and other vehicles ownership also increased. 
The owners used to travel by own vehicles especially. So in a commercial area like the shopping mall, 
cinema halls, banks, etc, people want to travel by own vehicle each car, bike and other vehicle needs 
proper parking space so that the parking demand will be increased as per the demand we should 
improve the parking facility. For that, we should analyse parking patterns.
